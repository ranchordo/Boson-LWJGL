#Boson-LWJGL
This is a recreation of the game BosonX by Mu and Heyo. This recreation uses the LightWeight Java Game Library to improve performance. All credit for level design, original game idea, and awesomeness go to them. I just made a copy.
Everything from the "resources" folder was taken from a decompilation of the BosonX Android app.

I will delete or edit these statements later:
*This is still in progress.* Whenever I have new functionality, I will sync everything over to here.
*This repo is still private.* That\'s because I am still waiting to hear back from the original developers about my legal ability to release this recreation.
*I expect that the final recreation* will use LWJGL 3.2 with the following bindings:
1. LWJGL
2. LWJGL-OpenGL
3. LWJGL-GLFW
4. LWJGL-OpenAL
5. LWJGL-OpenCL
6. LWJGL-OpenVR (Maybe)
