# Boson-LWJGL  
This is a recreation of the game BosonX by Mu and Heyo. This recreation uses the LightWeight Java Game Library to improve performance. All credit for level design, original game idea, and awesomeness go to them. I just made a copy.  
Everything from the "resources" folder (except for "shaders") was taken from a decompilation of the BosonX Android app.  
  
# A word about itstate.scrr:  
itstate.scrr is a score record file, hence the extension "scrr". If you delete this file, your high scores will be lost.  
There may be an itstate.scrr in /jar/ if I test the .jar before I push this and forget to delete it.  
It also might have a score under level 1 if I briefly test the level functionality.  
If you do not like this, just delete itstate.scrr and restart Boson-LWJGL.  
  
The easiest way to execute Boson-LWJGL is to just run /jar/Boson-LWJGL.jar.
  
I will delete or edit these statements later:  
*This is still in progress.* Whenever I have new functionality, I will sync everything over to here.  
*This repo is still private.* That\'s because I am still waiting to hear back from the original developers about my legal ability to release this recreation.  
*I expect that the final recreation* will use LWJGL 3.2 with the following bindings:  
1. LWJGL core  
2. LWJGL-OpenGL  
3. LWJGL-GLFW  
4. LWJGL-OpenAL  
5. LWJGL-OpenCL
